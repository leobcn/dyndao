Today, I learned about context propagation.  — I re-learned some things about
NSQ and requeueing. I think it would be wise to study the code.

Definitely, have to remember to not lose my head. Don’t lose my cool, don’t
lose my zen.

-> add mysql support.

-> haha, then add postgresql support.

-> we can also brush up the sqlite support, test type affinity, and blobs, etc.

-> code tons more tests and examples, it’ll help you with writing the
documentation.

THIS SHOULD BE EASY..

-> we should be able to write something that does say… an oracle to mysql
mapper.

:)

-> spend the day writing documentation, also. it’ll help for the release.

dyndao: can bump schema_test.go file, improve it and add a better comment
because the current one when you view it the schema folder in folder-mode in
github is “almost working nested object save”, which is no longer true - it’s
fully working :-)
