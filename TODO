- add more functionality
- add more tests
- clean up code
- turn on gometalinter

mapper:
	- needs more tests overall
	- not completely confident that mapper is in sufficient end-state

TODO

	- finish implementing table name usage (new table.Name override)
	- add tests for Delete

	- sqlite support for cascading key constraints on table schema
	- oracle text->CLOB mapper... what about adding constraints? aka IS JSON constraints.

	- use ChangedFields in update code so that we only update the values that changed....

	- TODO: oracle, add tests for varchar2 database type?
	- TODO: oracle, support JSON BLOB constraint on table
	- TODO: what do other databases (cough, sqlite) do in this area?

	- Review TODOs in code, in particular the transactions. Review the code overall.

	- consider sync.Map for object.Object

	- (With RetrieveObjects)
		Implement LIMIT... That's all a singular retrieve should be underneath the hood that's different.
	- use schema.Field.IsNumber more ?

* use ChildTable to determine whether we'll have an Intermediate Linking table or we will just use a more 
denormalized approach? Both are typical and should be able to be supported.

* review trello board (private)
