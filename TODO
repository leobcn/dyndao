- add more functionality
- add more tests
- clean up code

- turn on gometalinter

mapper:
	- needs more tests overall
	- not completely confident that mapper is in sufficient end-state

TODO
	- sqlite cascading key stuff

	- oracle text->CLOB mapper... what about constraints? aka IS JSON constraints.

	* oracle appears to be uppercasing all the column names during the RetrieveObjects code ... 
	How are we going to handle this now? :/
