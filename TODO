- add more functionality
- add more tests
- clean up code
- turn on gometalinter

TODO
	- sqlite support for cascading key constraints on table schema

	- oracle text->CLOB mapper... what about adding constraints? aka IS JSON constraints.

	* Sort out the float64 vs int64 debacle happening internally.

	--
	* TODO: oracle, support varchar2 data type
	* TODO: oracle, support JSON BLOB constraint on table
	* TODO: what do other databases (cough, sqlite) do in this area?
